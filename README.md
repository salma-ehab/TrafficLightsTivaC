# TrafficLightsEmbedded

***Description***

The goal of this project is to design a traffic light control system. The system contains simply two traffic lights. One allows the cars to move from 
north to south, and the other one allows cars to move from east to west. Beside each traffic there is also a pedestrian traffic light. The 
pedestrian has to press on a button to have his light green to cross the street safely.

This project was done using some functions that were provided in TivaWare Peripheral Driver Library
